# ðŸš€ ShrivenQ Architecture - Production Reality

## Executive Summary
ShrivenQ is an ultra-low latency trading platform designed for **sub-100Î¼s order execution**. This document reflects the ACTUAL architecture as implemented, with a pragmatic roadmap for expansion.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Latency First** - Every microsecond matters
2. **Pre-allocate Everything** - Zero allocations during trading hours
3. **Lock-free Where Possible** - Avoid contention
4. **Measure Everything** - You can't optimize what you don't measure
5. **Build â†’ Measure â†’ Optimize** - Don't optimize prematurely

## Memory Architecture (Implemented)

### 1. Lock-Free Memory Pool
- **Purpose**: General purpose allocations
- **Implementation**: `crossbeam::SegQueue` based
- **Features**:
  - Hazard pointers for safe reclamation
  - Pre-allocated chunks
  - Thread-safe without locks
  - O(1) allocation/deallocation

### 2. NUMA-Aware Allocator
- **Purpose**: Optimize memory access on multi-socket systems
- **Implementation**: Detects NUMA nodes, allocates locally
- **Features**:
  - Automatic node detection (Linux)
  - Thread-to-node affinity caching
  - Cross-node allocation fallback
  - Per-node statistics

### 3. Slab Allocator
- **Purpose**: Fixed-size object allocation (orders, messages)
- **Implementation**: Pre-allocated memory blocks
- **Key Design Decision**: Store pointers as `usize` to avoid Send/Sync issues
- **Features**:
  - 100% pre-allocated at startup
  - Zero allocations during trading
  - Lock-free via SegQueue
  - Cache-line aligned

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Current)
âœ… **COMPLETED**
- Memory management system
- Basic execution modes
- Build infrastructure
- Project structure

**Performance Metrics**:
- Allocation latency: < 1Î¼s (measured)
- Memory overhead: < 5% (acceptable)
- Thread contention: Zero (lock-free)

## Phase 2: Execution Framework (Next 4 weeks)
ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS**

### Execution Mode Architecture
```rust
pub enum ExecutionMode {
    Backtest,    // Historical replay
    Paper,       // Live data, fake fills
    Live,        // Real money
}
```

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. **Market Data Pipeline** (Week 1-2)
   - Zero-copy message parsing
   - Lock-free order book
   - Hardware timestamps

2. **Order Management** (Week 2-3)
   - Pre-allocated order pool
   - Lock-free order state machine
   - Latency tracking per order

3. **Risk Management** (Week 3-4)
   - Real-time position tracking
   - Pre-trade risk checks < 5Î¼s
   - Kill switch implementation

## Phase 3: Exchange Connectivity (Weeks 5-8)

### Smart Prioritization:
1. **Start with ONE exchange** (Binance)
   - REST for reference data
   - WebSocket for market data
   - FIX or REST for execution

2. **Then add Zerodha** for Indian markets
   - Different market structure
   - Will expose architectural issues

## Phase 4: GPU Acceleration (Weeks 9-12)

### Selective GPU Usage:
Only GPU-accelerate where it makes sense:
1. **Options Pricing** - Massive parallelism
2. **Risk Metrics** - Portfolio-wide calculations
3. **Technical Indicators** - Batch processing

NOT for:
- Order routing (latency sensitive)
- Market data (sequential)
- Risk checks (need immediate response)

## Phase 5: Production Hardening (Weeks 13-16)

1. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Distributed tracing
   - Performance profiling

2. **Testing**
   - Latency regression tests
   - Chaos engineering
   - Exchange simulator

3. **Deployment**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - Blue-green deployments

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Why Pre-allocation?
- **Predictable latency** - No GC, no allocation spikes
- **Better cache locality** - Memory stays hot
- **Simplified reasoning** - Memory layout is static

### Why Lock-free?
- **No thread blocking** - Critical for low latency
- **Better scaling** - No lock contention
- **Predictable performance** - No priority inversion

### Why Start Simple?
- **Prove the core** - Get <100Î¼s first, then add features
- **Fast iteration** - Simple system = fast changes
- **Early validation** - Test with real markets ASAP

## Performance Targets

### Latency Budgets (Microseconds)
```
Market Data Reception:          10 Î¼s
Order Book Update:              5 Î¼s
Signal Generation:              20 Î¼s
Risk Check:                     5 Î¼s
Order Creation:                 2 Î¼s
Order Transmission:             50 Î¼s
----------------------------------------
TOTAL:                         92 Î¼s (< 100 Î¼s target)
```

### Throughput Targets
- Market Data: 1M messages/second
- Order Rate: 10K orders/second
- Risk Calculations: 100K/second

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Measure First, Optimize Second**
   - Add metrics everywhere
   - Profile before optimizing
   - A/B test optimizations

2. **Keep It Simple**
   - Complexity kills performance
   - Every abstraction costs nanoseconds
   - Question every allocation

3. **Hardware Matters**
   - CPU pinning is essential
   - NUMA awareness is critical
   - Network card choice impacts latency

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement order book with lock-free updates
2. **Week 2**: Add Binance WebSocket connectivity
3. **Week 3**: Implement basic paper trading
4. **Week 4**: Benchmark and optimize

## Conclusion

This architecture prioritizes **working software over comprehensive documentation**. We've built a solid foundation with world-class memory management. Now we iterate quickly, measure obsessively, and optimize ruthlessly.

The path to <100Î¼s is through simplicity, not complexity.
