### ðŸš€ [Vision & Roadmap](VISION.md)
**Status: Long-term Strategy**

Comprehensive vision for ShrivenQ as the world's most advanced ultra-low latency trading platform:
- Sub-100Î¼s order-to-exchange latency targets
- CUDA acceleration specifications
- Multi-asset trading capabilities (Crypto/Equity/Options/Futures)
- Local exchange simulation
- Advanced features roadmap

**Target Capabilities:**
- GPU-accelerated risk calculations
- Real-time options pricing
- Unified execution across all asset classes
- Hardware acceleration integration

### ðŸ“š [ShrivenQuant Learnings](SHRIVENQUANT_LEARNINGS.md)
**Status: Historical Analysis**

Battle-tested insights from analyzing the previous ShrivenQuant codebase:
- Proven architectural patterns to preserve
- Critical issues to fix
- Performance optimization strategies
- Best practices for financial systems

**Key Takeaways:**
- Service-oriented architecture works well
- Lock-free data structures essential for HFT
- Proper error handling patterns
- Testing strategies that work

## Architecture Principles

### Core Design Philosophy
1. **Latency First** - Every microsecond matters in HFT
2. **Pre-allocate Everything** - Zero allocations during trading hours
3. **Lock-free Where Possible** - Avoid contention on hot paths
4. **Measure Everything** - Data-driven optimization
5. **Build â†’ Measure â†’ Optimize** - Evidence-based development

### Technical Standards
- **Memory**: Lock-free pools, NUMA-aware allocation, slab allocators
- **Networking**: Kernel bypass (DPDK/io_uring planned)
- **Data Structures**: Cache-line aligned, lock-free queues
- **Error Handling**: Result-based, no panics in production
- **Testing**: Property-based, chaos testing, performance regression detection

## Implementation Phases
